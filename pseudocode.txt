Once the pins are knocked, they will disappear

     /*----- constants -----*/

Define the bowling ball, canvas, the symbols for the amount of knocked pins, the arrows.


     /*----- state variables -----*/
     // score board 
array variable to represent the scoreboard;
varaiable to represent the total points of the game 
count the number of the throw ;
define which frame it is,
define the index of throw in each frame

 // canvas gamelane
define the pins
Define an variable to represent the position of the ball.
Variable to define the direction of the ball will go 
Variable to define the number of the knocked pins
variable to check the starting position of the bowling ball.
variable to check the ending position of the bowling ball.
variable to check the angle radian of the the ball being thrown


     /*----- cached elements -----*/
pop up menus (exit-game button; game result pop up window; user-guide)
the signal light to be switched between red and green;
the play again button to restart the game
the total value on the scoreboard on the DOM


     /*----- event listeners -----*/
1.click the ball,grab the ball, triggers the ball to move in the direction assigned .
2. when ball touches the channel, fall in the channel, change direction and go in Y direction, no pins get knocked down.
2. When the ball touches the bowling pins, trigger the bowling pins to fall and update the score on the score board.

     /*----- functions -----*/

     // canvas, gamelane
Init => scoreboard to be empty, bowing balls to be centered, bowling pins to be positions.
function to grab the ball(the mouse must be within the range of the radius of the ball);
function to drag the ball(mouseover to drage the ball);
function throw the ball(mouse up to let the ball go);
get the bowling ball rolling and stop once the ball is out of the end of bowling lane. (set interval)
function to check whether the bowling ball is in the range of hitting the pins.
function to check the collision on the channel -> change direction x ===0, ball goes forward;
function to check the collision on the pins -> distance of ball and pin should be less than the total of their radius ->  check how many pins are knocked and make the pins disappear.



  // scoreboard 
function to initiate the scorebaord;
function to define what is the index of the each throw in each frame;
function to caculate the sum;
function to check if the throw is a strike or spare and update the scoreboard;
function to render the scoreboard on DOM;


// If I have time,
1.I would have user move the ball left or right on a page, then have user randomly pick the power of ball and direction of where bowling ball is going.
2.Visually I would add images of pins instead white dots to represent pins and add animations to have pin fall when knocked. 
3.Make this a two player game.
4. Ideally I want to try to make this game 3D.
