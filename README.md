A bowling Game
Description: This is a bowling game where user will be able to click the ball, drag it and shoot it to hit the pins.The scoreboard will be correspondingly updated. 

Technologies Used:  JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Getting Started: 

Next Steps: 
1.add the power indicator and change power , may include the indicator of the direction the ball is going? 
2.change the start point of the ball, have user move the bowl left the right before throw it.
3.style the game web: change the color of the ball, add background, make the pins more visually appealing 
4.add instruction on how to play the game on game page;

bugs I have now:
5.scoreboard: add one more throw if the last frame is a strike
6. so far the game can not have strike, how to change it? add a random function(if the pin hit the ball.y+ball.r position, get a strike?)
7. it is rare to get a spare, how to change it?
